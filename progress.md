Original prompt: Build Alpha-7 Tanks Arena from the requirements in Docs/prompt.md, Docs/PRD.md, Docs/DESIGN.md, and Docs/Design Kit/*.png.

# Progress

## Bootstrap notes
- Read Docs/PRD.md, Docs/DESIGN.md, Docs/prompt.md, and inspected Docs/Design Kit PNG references image.png through image8.png.
- No Docs/SPEC.md exists in this checkout; current implementation treats PRD + prompt as product/spec authority and DESIGN.md + Design Kit PNGs as visual authority.
- Pre-implementation standalone review found sequencing risks. Adjusted execution plan:
  - Pull minimal landing/name/tank/lobby flows earlier than the original Phase 10.
  - Add authoritative room tick, movement, and transform sync with the first playable slice.
  - Model HUD around battle royale alive count, placement, zone phase/timer, and room code instead of team-deathmatch score bars where examples conflict.
  - Keep noninteractive HUD panels pointer-passive; only buttons, forms, joysticks, and action controls opt into pointer events.
  - Choose late join after lock as spectator/rejected-by-flow depending on private/public state; active player join locks once countdown starts.
- Frontend design thesis: warm concrete tactical arena with light translucent instrument panels, compact mono data labels, modular concrete walls, and orange only for threat/action/selection.
- User provided a local realtime tanks reference at `/Users/kbediako/Code/realtime-tanks-demo`; inspect it read-only/outside this repo when server/client parity questions arise.

## Phase 1 scaffold checkpoint
- Created the pnpm workspace, TypeScript base config, Vite/React/three client shell, Express + Colyseus server shell, shared package exports, deployment stubs, env example, README, references, and third-party notices.
- Fixed Colyseus schema emit by disabling define-style class field output so schema accessors track state mutations.
- Standalone dev scripts build the shared package before starting client/server because ignored `dist/` outputs are required by package exports.
- Server startup awaits the Colyseus listen promise before logging readiness.
- Colyseus matchmaking CORS and WebSocket origin verification are bound to the same origin policy as Express instead of echoing arbitrary origins.
- `PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL` is automatically included in the server origin allowlist so matchmake and WebSocket policy cannot diverge in common deployment configs.
- Server config loads the repo-root `.env` by module location, so filtered pnpm server scripts honor the documented root `.env.example` flow.
- Private-room creation marks the Colyseus room listing private so quick play does not match into coded lobbies.
- Verification:
  - `pnpm install`
  - `pnpm check`
  - `pnpm start`
  - `curl http://localhost:2567/healthz`
  - Colyseus `joinOrCreate("battle_royale", { seed: "phase1-smoke" }, Alpha7StateSchema)` decoded synced state with `matchState`, `roomCode`, and `seed`.
  - CORS smoke on alternate port verified allowed matchmake origins are echoed and disallowed origins are not.
  - WebSocket handshake smoke verified disallowed origins receive `403 Origin not allowed`.
  - Deployment-origin smoke verified a `PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL` value not repeated in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` can still matchmake and complete the WebSocket upgrade.
  - Temporary root `.env` probe verified `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server ...` reads root env values while running from `apps/server`.
  - Private-room smoke verified `create(..., { privateRoom: true })` stays separate from quick play.
- Post-fix `codex review --uncommitted` found no discrete correctness, security, or maintainability issues; its independent `pnpm check` also passed.
- Post-Phase-1 collab-deliberation recommended committing Phase 1 now, then keeping the next protocol contract work single-owned across shared/server until the first playable state contract is green.

## Phase 2 shared contract checkpoint
- Added shared gameplay constants/config for weapons, pickups, abilities, tank archetypes, defaults, and exact match state/room protocol values.
- Added Colyseus schema classes for match core state, zone state, players, projectiles, pickups, and the Alpha-7 room state; schemas stay exported from `@alpha7/shared/schema`.
- Added typed client/server room message payloads for join, ready, input, fire, ability, rematch, system, and error channels from the shared root package.
- Added focused shared tests for protocol values, gameplay config sanity, schema defaults, synchronized match-state helper behavior, and message payload typing.
- Kept the root barrel free of schema runtime exports so client bundles can import lightweight constants/messages without pulling schema classes unless needed.
- Post-implementation elegance pass removed a no-op seed setter and duplicate state schema alias before commit.
- Verification:
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/shared typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/shared test` (7 tests)
  - `pnpm check`
  - `codex review --uncommitted` found no actionable correctness issues before the elegance trim.
  - Post-Phase-2 collab-deliberation recommended committing the shared contract and implementing Phase 3 with `BattleRoyaleRoom` as the single server owner for admission, ready/start, transitions, locking, and late-join policy.

## Phase 3 server lifecycle checkpoint
- Implemented `BattleRoyaleRoom` lifecycle for `battle_royale`: waiting lobby admission, sanitized join/tank updates, host assignment, ready flow, host start, countdown, room lock/unlock, timed `running -> danger -> final_zone -> finished` transitions, metadata updates, and rematch-vote skeleton.
- Added defensive server-side parsing for join, ready, start, input, fire, ability, and rematch messages. Active input/fire/ability messages are stored as intents only and are rejected unless the room is active and the player is alive, connected, and not spectating.
- Added `CLIENT_MESSAGE_TYPES.START` and `StartMessagePayload` to the shared protocol so host start is not server-local.
- Private rooms still use generated room codes and `setPrivate`; public rooms keep matchmaking metadata for later lobby/client flows.
- Rematch votes are gated to `finished` and cleared for active-match disconnects so stale votes cannot leak into the future rematch implementation.
- Added server room lifecycle tests covering metadata/private rooms, sanitized players, host reassignment, auto-locked final seats, ready countdown, lock/unlock late-join rejection, host-only start, timed state transitions, defensive intents, server-owned weapon validation, rematch gating, and inactive-player intent rejection.
- Standalone review found and parent fixed final-seat auto-lock admission and client-selected weapon override risks; elegance review then removed dead lifecycle state, a fake countdown trigger parameter, and duplicated tank config application.
- Verification:
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/shared typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/shared test` (7 tests)
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server test` (9 tests)
  - `pnpm check`

## Playable arena slice checkpoint
- Added deterministic shared arena generation with seeded RNG, maze/floor/wall/collision data, connected path validation, open pockets, choke detection, spawn selection, pickup placement, safe-zone phase planning, and shared tests for determinism, connectivity, spawn fairness, pickup validity, zone planning, and basic combat/pickup constants.
- Synced generated arena config through the Colyseus room state for clients, assigns deterministic spawn positions on join/start, resets match state on start, applies authoritative movement with arena bounds and wall collision, updates zone phase metadata, and expires stale movement intents so stalled clients cannot keep driving.
- Replaced the static client preview with a Colyseus-backed playable shell: name/tank select, quick play, public/private lobby creation, case-preserving room-code joins, lobby ready/start flow, fullscreen three.js arena renderer, server-map parsing, local interpolation/prediction, tank meshes, world/minimap zone rendering, desktop keyboard/mouse input, mobile joystick/aim/fire/ability controls, and WebGL fallback messaging.
- Applied the Alpha-7 HUD direction from DESIGN.md and the design-kit references: warm concrete/slate palette, translucent panels, mono data labels, orange only for primary/action/threat states, safe-area aware mobile controls, and pointer-passive HUD panels outside interactive controls.
- Standalone review found and parent fixed room-code case/Enter join regressions, renderer callback churn, narrow-viewport camera framing, inactive-match local movement drift, alive-count clamping, and stale server movement intents.
- Collab-deliberation recommended committing this validated playable slice now and carrying the Vite chunk-size warning as a performance follow-up in the next gameplay bundle.
- Verification:
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/client typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/client build`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server test` (13 tests)
  - `pnpm check`
  - `codex review --uncommitted` and focused stale-intent review; latest focused review found no actionable regressions.
  - Two-client Colyseus smoke verified arena sync, match start, and server-owned movement.
  - Desktop Playwright smoke captured a rendered server-sourced arena; mobile headless smoke verified lobby/HUD/control layout with WebGL fallback.
- Known follow-up:
  - Vite reports the client bundle chunk exceeds 500 kB after minification because React/three are bundled together; defer code splitting/manual chunks to the next performance pass.

## Combat, endgame, editor, and asset checkpoint
- Implemented server-authoritative combat systems: fire intents, cooldown validation, cannon/light/MG/explosive projectile simulation, wall/tank collision, splash damage, shield/armor/health damage, kill credit, death/spectator state, placement, winner resolution, zone damage, pickup collection/respawn/effects, ability activation, and rematch reset.
- Fixed a Colyseus patch reliability risk from the large synced arena JSON by raising the schema encoder buffer at server startup.
- Added deterministic zero-survivor final-zone resolution so simultaneous deaths still produce a single living placement-1 winner by tiebreaker instead of a dead first-place/no-winner state.
- Wired rematch votes through replicated `isReady` state so the results UI can show and clear each player's rematch readiness.
- Expanded the client into a fuller live-demo shell: projectile/pickup/zone rendering, combat effects, spectator/death overlay, results/winner screen, rematch/play-again actions, disconnect/error overlay, compact mobile HUD chips, and mobile ability control state.
- Added `/editor` with seed/reroll/player-count controls, wall/spawn/pickup/zone overlays, export/copy config, tank skin previews, and mobile HUD/control safe-zone overlays.
- Added the asset pipeline under `apps/client/public/assets/` with manifest, generated-asset notes, replacement folders, placeholder SVG icons, runtime manifest fetch, manifest-backed UI icon lookup, and optional renderer texture lookup with procedural fallback.
- Refreshed README and notices for deployment, mobile demo QA, multiplayer QA, asset replacement, known limitations, reference repo, generated placeholders, and font sources.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server test` (20 tests)
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/client typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/client build`
  - `pnpm check`
  - `curl http://localhost:2567/healthz`
  - `curl http://localhost:5173/`
  - `curl http://localhost:5173/editor`
  - Two-client Colyseus smoke verified private room-code join, countdown to running, large arena patch sync, movement intents, fire intents, and readiness replication.
- Known follow-up:
  - Physical iPhone Safari / Android Chrome testing is still manual.
  - Vite still warns that the main client chunk is larger than 500 kB.
  - Reconnect is currently an error/rejoin path rather than true mid-match session resumption.

## Manual browser feedback pass
- Addressed in-app browser feedback from the live demo:
  - Constrained the ability-charge bar inside its HUD tile by switching the fill to a clipped scale transform.
  - Changed procedural tank barrels from full orange prisms to muted single barrels with small orange muzzle tips so aiming no longer reads as two cannons.
  - Reworked the minimap into an aspect-correct inner map frame and renders all synced wall rectangles instead of a truncated sample.
  - Tuned active-match HUD panels toward the `goal.png` reference with lighter glass, tighter radius, and lower shadow/blur.
  - Added `/assets/audio/ambient-music.wav` from the user-provided local sound file and manifest-backed playback after the first user gesture for mobile browser compatibility.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/client typecheck`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/client build`
  - `pnpm --filter @alpha7/server test` (20 tests)
  - `curl -I http://localhost:5173/assets/audio/ambient-music.wav`
  - `curl -s http://localhost:5173/assets/manifest.json`
